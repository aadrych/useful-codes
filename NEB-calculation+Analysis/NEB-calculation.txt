I am currently working on an Nudged elastic band calculation in lammps 
to try and approximate what the displacement threshold energy might be for a bcc iron lattice. 

The python script Buildjobs.py is used to make several folders, filled 
with the necessary input files, for a lammps simulation caluclating neb 
for the iron system. It takes a base input script called in.base, that 
sets up my lammps simualtion, along with my starting and end 
coordinates, that I think the system will look like with a PKA 
interaction.
It also outputs a file called joblist.txt.  This is a list that is read 
by the file fixedz.sh. 
The fixedz.sh is an submission script to the csf. 
It will run the lammps simulations for all the different folders, using 
the joblist.txt file to find which folders are of interest. 

There is alot of output from the lammps simulation because it has to be 
run using a partition on a computer processor.  This means that the neb 
calucaltion is run in parrallel and simultaneously to try and predict 
how the energy changes as an atom moves from my input starting 
coordinates, to my final atom coordinates.
  
Running the run1.py script extracts what the barrier energy is from the 
neb output. It runs the bash scipt GetResults.sh, which extract 
what the reaction coordiates and the associated energy of the system 
along this path. 
The python script then calls the application gnuplot to plot the 
results, and saves it to a png file.
To run gnuplot from python, the gnuplot.py folders should be downloaded and installed, as described in :
http://gnuplot-py.sourceforge.net/
 
I have also included a matlab script which plot the coordinates for the final atom position so that you can see how I have moved the atom
