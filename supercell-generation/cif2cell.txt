Cif2cell is a useful code that is easy to download from the internet.
It can take the output from databases, like crystalworks, for a specific 
element or alloy, and produce the equivalent data for unit cells as 
input for prorgams like CASTEP and VASP. 
The supercell can easily be output as well.

I have included the a simple cif output from crystalworks for alpha 
zirconium. 
After downloading the folder of cif2cell from 
:http://sourceforge.net/projects/cif2cell/ copy the crystalworks file 
into the cif2cell folder and run:
./cif2cell icsd_53785.cif 
--no-reduce --supercell=[3,3,3] --program=castep -o 
zr-supercell.out
This can be changed for vasp and you can ignore the supercell entry if a 
basic unit cell is needed.
